# Data_transfer_from_terminal_to_SD_card_using_UART_with_STM32F1
In the Embedded System course, it is a project that we write in a text file with the txt extension on the micro-sd card of the characters we write from the terminal using UART communication. We wrote our code with Keil, but we also made use of the cube library.
